open-data-scotland
==================

The file `scotland-data-portals.csv` contains a list of sites in Scotland
that are partially or wholly focussed on making open data
available. The list only includes sites that provide access to a number of
datasets, rather than just a single dataset.

A criterion for inclusion is that access to data is made available in at least
one of the following modes:

* bulk download in a machine readable format (e.g., CSV, RSS, XML);
* via a documented API; or
* as a SPARQL endpoint.

The CSV data file is published in a more readable format at http://okfnscot.github.io/open-data-scotland/

A longer list of web sites in Scotland that information available can
be found at
[Scotland's Data](https://sites.google.com/site/scotlandsdata/dataandvocabularies).
However, not all of these sites meet the above criteria and some of
the links are now out of date.
